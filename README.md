# Multi-Domain-resource-allocation-using-GNN-and-RL-Thesis-


## Overview
This project develops a **hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework** for **real-time multi-agent resource optimization**.  
It is designed to optimize resources across multiple interacting entities, with applications in **industrial energy, urban traffic, logistics, and supply chains**.

---

## Key Features
- **Hybrid RL + GNN Architecture:** Combines graph-based modeling with reinforcement learning for optimal decision-making.  
- **Multi-Agent Optimization:** Handles multiple interacting nodes with dynamic resource allocation.  
- **Real-Time Deployment:** Designed for simulation and potential real-world implementation.  
- **Domain-Agnostic:** Applicable to industries, cities, logistics networks, and farm-to-market supply chains.  

---

## Potential Applications
- Industrial energy usage optimization  
- Urban traffic and transportation management  
- Logistics and warehouse optimization  
- Farm-to-market distribution and cold-chain logistics  
- Smart city resource allocation and multi-agent coordination

## Methodology
1. **Graph Modeling**
   - Nodes represent entities (factories, vehicles, intersections, farms, warehouses).  
   - Edges represent dependencies, routes, or resource flows.  

2. **GNN Module**
   - Generates **node embeddings** capturing both local and global network/resource states.  

3. **RL Module**
   - Takes embeddings as input to **learn optimal allocation policies**.  
   - Reward functions target efficiency, latency reduction, throughput, or resource utilization.  

4. **Simulation & Deployment**
   - Simulates realistic environments such as industrial grids, traffic systems, warehouses, or farm-to-market logistics.  
   - Demonstrates **deployable, measurable policies** with tangible improvements.  

---

## Highlights
- Demonstrates **scalable, multi-domain resource optimization**.  
- Provides a **deployable framework** for research, simulations, or prototype applications.  
- Showcases **cutting-edge RL + GNN techniques** for real-world problems.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for RL + GNN)  
- NetworkX for graph modeling  
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib  
- Optional: Gym or custom simulation environment  

---

## Future Work
- Extend to **multi-agent cooperative RL** for larger networks.  
- Integrate **predictive analytics** for dynamic demand forecasting.  
- Real-world deployment for **industrial, urban, or supply-chain applications**.

## 🔑 Key Features

* ⚡ **Hybrid RL + GNN** – Leverages graph-based learning with reinforcement signals for robust optimization
* 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination** – Scales to multiple interacting entities (factories, vehicles, warehouses, intersections, etc.)
* 🕒 **Real-Time Focus** – Optimized for both simulations and deployable real-world policies
* 🌐 **Domain-Agnostic** – Easily adaptable to **industry, cities, logistics, or farm-to-market systems**

---

## 📌 Potential Applications

* 🏭 **Industrial energy** consumption & scheduling
* 🚦 **Urban traffic** flow & congestion control
* 📦 **Logistics & warehouse** optimization
* 🥬 **Farm-to-market cold-chain** distribution
* 🏙️ **Smart city** resource coordination

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Graph Modeling

* **Nodes** → entities (factories, vehicles, intersections, farms, warehouses)
* **Edges** → dependencies, routes, or resource flows

### 2️⃣ GNN Module

* Learns **node embeddings** capturing local & global states

### 3️⃣ RL Module

* Uses embeddings to learn **optimal allocation policies**
* Reward functions balance **efficiency, latency, throughput, utilization**

### 4️⃣ Simulation & Deployment

* Tested on synthetic & realistic environments (grids, traffic, warehouses)
* Generates **deployable, measurable policies**
